Ideal Desk Height for a 6’2” Tall Person
Introduction
If you’re 6’2”, many desks can still feel a bit too low. Most standard desks are made for average-height users, which can cause tall people to lean forward or raise their shoulders while working. Over time, this can lead to neck, back, and shoulder pain.
Getting the right desk height helps you sit and work more comfortably throughout the day.

The Best Desk Height for a 6’2” Person
For someone who is 6’2”, the ideal desk height is usually:
28.5 to 30 inches from the floor to the top of the desk
This height works best when:
Your feet are flat on the floor


Your knees are at about hip level


Your elbows bend at about 90 degrees


Your shoulders stay relaxed


If you use a standing desk, a good standing height is usually:
43 to 45 inches


These numbers are general guidelines. Your arm length, chair height, and posture can affect what feels best for you.

Why Desk Height Matters
Using the wrong desk height can cause discomfort over time:
Neck pain from leaning forward


Shoulder tension from raised arms


Lower back pain from slouching


Wrist strain from awkward typing angles


A desk at the right height helps keep your body aligned and reduces daily fatigue.

Common Mistakes Tall People Make
Using a standard desk without checking the height
 Most desks are about 28 inches tall, which may still be too low for someone 6’2”.
Raising the chair too much
 This can cause your feet to lose contact with the floor.
Ignoring monitor height
 A low screen can cause neck strain even if your desk height is correct.
Typing with bent wrists
 Wrists should stay straight while typing, not angled up or down.

Simple Setup Tips
Adjust your chair before your desk


Keep your elbows close to your body


Position your monitor at eye level


Use a footrest if your feet don’t sit flat

Final Thoughts
For a 6’2” tall person, the right desk height can improve comfort, posture, and focus. Small changes to your setup can make a big difference in how you feel during and after work.
