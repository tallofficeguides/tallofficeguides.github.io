Ideal Desk Height for a 6’4” Tall Person
Introduction
If you’re 6’4”, a standard desk can feel way too low. You may find yourself hunching your shoulders, bending your neck, or slouching forward just to type. Over time, this can cause back pain, neck strain, and tired shoulders.
The good news is that a small adjustment to your desk height can make a big difference in comfort and posture.

The Best Desk Height for a 6’4” Person
For someone who is 6’4”, the ideal desk height is usually:
29.5 to 31 inches from the floor to the desktop
This range works for most tall people when:
Your feet are flat on the floor


Your elbows are bent at about 90 degrees


Your forearms rest comfortably on the desk or armrests


If you use a standing desk, the ideal standing height is usually:
44 to 46 inches


These numbers are guidelines. Your exact setup may vary depending on arm length, chair height, and posture.

Why Desk Height Matters
Using the wrong desk height can cause problems over time:
Shoulder pain from raising your arms too high


Neck strain from leaning forward


Lower back pain from slouching


Wrist discomfort from poor typing angles


A properly sized desk helps keep your spine straight, shoulders relaxed, and arms in a natural position.

Common Mistakes Tall People Make
Using a standard desk without adjustment
 Most desks are around 28–29 inches tall, which is often too low for someone 6’4”.
Raising the chair too high
 This can leave your feet dangling and put pressure on your thighs.
Ignoring monitor height
 Even with the right desk height, a low monitor can cause neck strain.
Typing with bent wrists
 Your wrists should stay straight while typing, not angled up or down.

Simple Setup Tips
Adjust your chair first, then match your desk to it


Keep your elbows close to your body


Make sure your screen is at eye level


Use a footrest if your feet don’t rest flat



Frequently Asked Questions
Is a standing desk better for tall people?
 Standing desks work very well for tall users because they allow easy height adjustment.
Can I just add a keyboard tray?
 Yes, a keyboard tray can help if your desk is slightly too high.
What if my desk is too low and can’t be adjusted?
 Desk risers or furniture lifts can raise it a few inches.
Does arm length matter more than height?
 Both matter. Taller people usually have longer arms, which affects desk height needs.

Final Thoughts
For a 6’4” tall person, the right desk height can greatly improve comfort and reduce pain. Small adjustments to your setup can make a big difference in how you feel at the end of the day.
