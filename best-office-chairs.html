Best Office Chairs for Tall People (6’2” and Above)
Introduction
If you’re tall, finding a good office chair can be frustrating. Many chairs are built for average-height users. This often means the seat is too short, the backrest doesn’t support your shoulders, and the headrest hits the wrong spot—or isn’t there at all.
Over time, a poor-fitting chair can cause back pain, neck strain, sore knees, and bad posture. The right chair for a tall person should support your full body, not force you to slouch or squeeze into a space that’s too small.
This guide is written for tall people who work at a desk and want comfort, support, and better posture.

What to Look For
When shopping for an office chair as a tall person, focus on these key features:
Seat height
Look for a chair with a high maximum seat height so your legs can rest comfortably.


Seat depth
A deeper seat supports longer thighs and helps reduce pressure behind the knees.


Backrest height
The backrest should support your upper back and shoulders, not stop halfway up.


Adjustable lumbar support
Your lower back needs support that can move up or down to match your height.


Headrest (adjustable)
A headrest is important for neck support, especially if you lean back often.


High weight capacity
Taller people often need a stronger frame for long-term durability.

Frequently Asked Questions

 Most tall people need a chair that adjusts above 20 inches in seat height.
Is a headrest necessary?
 Not required, but very helpful for neck support, especially if you recline or sit for long hours.
Are gaming chairs good for tall people?
 Some are. Look for XL or “tall” models with long backrests and deep seats.
Should I use a footrest if the chair is high?
 Only if your feet don’t reach the floor comfortably. Proper leg support is key.
