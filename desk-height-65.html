Ideal Desk Height for a 6’5” Tall Person
Introduction
If you’re 6’5”, most desks feel too low. Standard desks are built for average-height users, not tall people. This often leads to slouching, raised shoulders, and neck pain—especially if you work at a desk for many hours a day.
The right desk height helps your body stay relaxed and supported while you work.

The Best Desk Height for a 6’5” Person
For someone who is 6’5”, the ideal desk height is usually:
30 to 32 inches from the floor to the top of the desk
This height works best when:
Your feet are flat on the floor


Your elbows bend at about 90 degrees


Your shoulders stay relaxed


Your wrists stay straight while typing


If you use a standing desk, a good standing height is usually:
45 to 47 inches


These are general guidelines. Arm length, chair height, and posture can slightly change what feels best for you.

Why Desk Height Matters
A desk that’s too low or too high can cause problems over time:
Back pain from slouching


Neck strain from leaning forward


Shoulder tension from raised arms


Wrist pain from awkward typing angles


When your desk is at the right height, your body stays in a natural position, which reduces pain and fatigue.

Common Mistakes Tall People Make
Using a standard desk
 Most desks are about 28–29 inches tall, which is often too low for someone 6’5”.
Raising the chair too high
 This can cause your feet to dangle and put pressure on your legs.
Ignoring screen height
 If your monitor is too low, you’ll bend your neck even if the desk height is correct.
Skipping arm support
 Lack of arm support can strain your shoulders over time.

Simple Setup Tips
Adjust your chair before adjusting your desk


Keep elbows close to your body


Place the top of your screen at eye level


Use a footrest if needed



Frequently Asked Questions
Is a standing desk good for tall people?
 Yes. Standing desks are great for tall users because they adjust higher than standard desks.
Can I fix a desk that’s too low?
 Yes. Desk risers or furniture lifts can raise your desk a few inches.
Does desk depth matter?
 Yes. A deeper desk helps keep your monitor at a safe distance.
Should my arms rest on the desk or armrests?
 Either is fine, as long as your shoulders stay relaxed.

Final Thoughts
For a 6’5” tall person, the right desk height can greatly improve comfort and posture. Small adjustments can help you work longer with less pain and strain.
